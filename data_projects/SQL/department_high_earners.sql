-- As part of an ongoing analysis of salary distribution within the company, your manager has requested a 
-- report identifying high earners in each department. A 'high earner' within a department is defined as an employee with a 
-- salary ranking among the top three salaries within that department.

-- You're tasked with identifying these high earners across all departments. 
-- Write a query to display the employee's name along with their department name and salary. 
-- In case of duplicates, sort the results of department name in ascending order, then by salary in descending order.
-- If multiple employees have the same salary, then order them alphabetically.
